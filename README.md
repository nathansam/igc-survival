R Markdown documents/materials demonstrating how to conduct survival analysis.
Originally, these files were created as part of the Institute of Genetics and
Cancer's Statistical Seminar series but provide general guidance on how to
perform survival analysis in R.

## Layout

No knowledge of Git/Github is required to view the demonstrations. Clicking the 
below links will take you to webpages which explain how to perform survival
analysis (and includes R code). 

* [Kaplan-Meier](Demos/Kaplan-Meier/Kaplan-Meier.md)
* [Cox proportional hazards](Demos/Cox-PH/Cox-PH.md)
* [Accelerated failure time models](Demos/AFT/AFT.md)
* Competing risks, see [VallejosGroup/CompRisksVignettes](https://github.com/VallejosGroup/CompRisksVignettes)
* [Joint models](Demos/JM/JM.md)

A pdf version of the slides from the presentation can be found
[here](Presentation.pdf)

I have also uploaded the [R script](Figures.R) used to produce the figures in
the presentation and the [figures](Figures) themselves.
